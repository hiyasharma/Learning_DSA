Following are the Array Problems:

1) Program to find the minimum (or maximum) element of an array:
There are few methods:
i) Using sort function {sort(a, a + n);} ==> 
Time complexity : O(n log(n))
Auxiliary Space : O(1)
ii) function findMinAndMax(arr, n):
    // Step 2: Initialization
    minVal = arr[0]
    maxVal = arr[0]

    // Step 3: Iterate Through the Array
    for i from 1 to n-1:
        // Update minVal if the current element is smaller
        if arr[i] < minVal:
            minVal = arr[i]

        // Update maxVal if the current element is larger
        if arr[i] > maxVal:
            maxVal = arr[i]

    // Step 4: Output
    return minVal, maxVal
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

iii) Using Library functions: 
We can use min_element() and max_element() to find minimum and maximum of array. 
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

2) Last duplicate element in a sorted array

for i = n-1 to 0
   if (arr[i] == arr[i-1])
        Print current element and its index.
        Return
If no such element found print a message    of no duplicate found.

Time Complexity: O(n) 
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

3) Most frequent element in an array

1. Initialize variables: max_count = 0, element_having_max_freq
2. For each element 'ele' in the array:
   a. Set count = 0
   b. For each element 'arr[i]' in the array:
      - If 'ele' is equal to 'arr[i]', increment count
   c. If count is greater than max_count:
      - Update max_count to be equal to count
      - Update element_having_max_freq to be equal to 'ele'
3. Return element_having_max_freq as the most frequent element

Time Complexity : o(n^2)
Auxiliary space: o(1)

4. Find a Fixed Point (Value equal to index) in a given array
(Linear Search) 
Linearly search for an index i such that arr[i] == i.

Time Complexity: O(n) 
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

5. Find the element that appears once in an array where every other element appears twice

Time complexity of this solution is O(n2)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

6. Find common elements in three sorted arrays

Initialize both pointers i and j to 0, and an empty list common.
While both pointers i and j are within the bounds of the two arrays:
If arr1[i] is less than arr2[j], increment i by 1.
If arr2[j] is less than arr1[i], increment j by 1.
If arr1[i] is equal to arr2[j]:
Add arr1[i] to the common list.
Increment both i and j by 1.
Return the common list containing the common elements of the two arrays.

Time Complexity: O(n1+n2+n3)

7. Check for Majority Element in a sorted array

Using Moore Voting Algorithm
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

8. Find the Missing Number
using sum formula
N(N+1)/2 & N=n+1;

Let's look at the example with the array {1, 2, 3, 5}:

total is initially calculated as the sum of numbers from 1 to 5 ((5 * (5 + 1)) / 2), which is 15.
In the loop, it subtracts each element of the array: total -= 1, total -= 2, total -= 3, total -= 5.
The final value of total after these subtractions is total = 4.
Therefore, 4 is the missing number in the sequence.

Time Complexity: O(N)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
